Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:
Step 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph that depicts the relationships in the scenario.
The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in "var1 -> var2" format, separated by commas.
Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices
include "marginal probability", "conditional probability", "explaining away effect", "backdoor adjustment set", "average treatment effect", "collider bias", "normal counterfactual question", "average
treatment effect on treated", "natural direct effect" or "natural indirect effect". Your answer should
only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks.
Step 3) Formalize the query: Translate the query into its formal mathematical expression based on its
type, utilizing the "do(Â·)" notation or counterfactual notations as needed.
Step 4) Gather all relevant data: Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing
but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form "P(...)=..." or "P(...|...)=...", each
probability being separated by a semicolon. Stick to the previously mentioned denotations for the
variables.
Step 5) Deduce the estimand using causal inference: Given all the information above, deduce the
estimand using skills such as do-calculus, counterfactual prediction, and the basics of probabilities.
Answer step by step.
Step 6) Calculate the estimand: Insert the relevant data in Step 4 into the estimand, perform basic
arithmetic calculations, and derive the final answer. There is an identifiable answer. Answer step by
